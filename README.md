# PlateformeTROC
First of all, let me explain why we are using the branches.
Everyone will get the project from the start, meaning with the DB (entities), the template and the FOS_user and then will start to work on it.
Then, when you finish a part of your work, you commit on YOUR branch that way we keep the master branch as a clean version of the project.
Whenever you want, you can make a merge request meaning that you want to integrate your work on your branch with the master branch.
The supervisors (Anis and Karim) will then look for conflicts. If there are, they are going to work together with the developper on solving them, else it's going smoothly.
So remember to allways commit on your own branch please.
